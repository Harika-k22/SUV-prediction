SUV prediction using Logistic Regression involves predicting whether a person is likely to purchase an SUV 
based on features like age and estimated salary.
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome in this case,
purchase (1) or no purchase (0).
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained to find the relationship between 
the input features and the target variable. Once trained, the model predicts outcomes on new data.
Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix. 
Visualization techniques like heatmaps help interpret the results effectively.
